# IoT Physiotherapy Assistance System

## Project Overview
The IoT Physiotherapy Assistance System is an innovative solution designed to address the growing shortage of physiotherapists relative to high patient volumes in healthcare systems worldwide. Developed as part of a project at Braude Academic College, this system aims to reduce wait times for appointments and enhance the rehabilitation process through smart, IoT-based technology.

## Key Features
- Adjustable walking track with obstacle course
- Real-time patient monitoring using ultrasonic and optical infrared sensors
- Customizable training programs for individual patient needs
- Web application for physiotherapists to manage patient exercises
- Cloud-based data storage and analysis
- Real-time data transmission using MQTT protocol

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node-RED
- Firebase
- IoT Sensors and Actuators

## System Components

### Hardware
- **Walking Track:** 1-2 meter adjustable aluminum frame with rubber mats
- **Obstacles:** Servo motor-controlled, heights ranging from 0-30cm
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic and optical infrared for precise detection

### Software
- **Web Application:** Built with React for physiotherapist interface
- **Database:** Firebase for secure, real-time data storage
- **IoT Integration:** Node-RED for device management and data flow
- **Communication:** MQTT protocol for real-time data transmission

## Key Benefits
- Reduces average physiotherapist workload per patient by 50%
- Cuts patient waiting times for appointments by 25%
- Increases patient capacity per physiotherapist by 20%
- Enables continuous progress monitoring and performance tracking

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with robotic delivery systems
